# Frequently Asked Questions

### Which version of **X** are we using?
Currently, we are working with **Unreal Engine 4.22.3** and **Visual Studio 2017**. There are plans to upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 eventually, but that isn't a priority at time of writing.

### I think **X** would be a super cool feature! Can I create **X**?
No-one is stopping you from experimenting and creating your own features. However, Klavvy gets the final say as to what gets to go into the official release. It is recommended you consult the team first before spending time on a feature that might not be accepted. Alternatively, you can keep that feature for your own personal build.

### What is the current release-schedule plan?
First, we would like to release a minor patch (**v1.0.5**) sometime this year, which would include a handful of bug fixes, optimizations, and some additional cosmetics. This would give time to get acquainted with the project before proceeding with larger goals.  
After the v1.0.5 release, development of **v2.0.0** will take focus, which will have features that are yet to be determined (examples include: official modding support, custom campaigns, etc.).

### Can I share information about this dev team?
No. Klavvy has requested that we keep this under-wraps for the time being. People should assume that the current version of Manic Miners is the "completed" product. Until we have something shippable and ready to show, we should refrain from letting anyone know about this closed-development team.
